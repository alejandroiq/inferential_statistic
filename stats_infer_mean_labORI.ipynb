    "As a research assistant at a marine biology research center, you're helping analyze data from a coral restoration project. The center has been growing different genotypes of staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) in their nursery to determine which genetic strains show the best growth potential for reef restoration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research team has collected growth data (measured in centimeters of linear extension) over 1 year for 6 different coral genotypes. Initial fragments sizes were within .05cm of each other and only single tip fragments were used. Within the nursery 10 fragments from each genotype were placed on each growout tree (60 fragments total) for a total of 50 trees. This was done to try and control for any variation within the nursery setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine if there are significant differences in growth rates between these genotypes, which will help inform which strains should be prioritized for future restoration efforts.\n",
