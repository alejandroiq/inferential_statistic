INFERENTIAL STATISTICS â€“ STUDY NOTES & EXERCISES

This repository includes exercises covering probability, distributions, and inferential statistics. The content builds progressively from fundamental concepts like probability to more advanced topics such as hypothesis testing, A/B experiments, and non-parametric methods.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: PROBABILITY & DISTRIBUTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
Defined probability as the foundation of statistical thinking, including outcomes, events, and likelihood.

Explored probability distributions, both discrete and continuous, including their use in modeling real-world randomness.

Studied the normal distribution and its properties, along with the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution).

Practiced computing probabilities under the curve and using Z-scores for standardization.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: STATISTICAL INFERENCE & THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM
------------------------------------------------------------
Introduced sampling theory and how sample statistics are used to estimate population parameters.

Discussed the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and its importance in making inference valid for large samples.

Constructed and interpreted confidence intervals to estimate population means and proportions.

Laid the foundation for hypothesis testing by discussing population vs. sample logic.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN & HYPOTHESIS TESTING
------------------------------------------------------------
Learned to define null and alternative hypotheses for testing.

Explored Type I and Type II errors, significance levels (alpha), and p-values.

Understood the structure of a valid experiment and how to design tests with control and treatment groups.

Evaluated statistical significance and decision-making using the logic of inference.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 4: A/B TESTING & DIGITAL EXPERIMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------
Applied hypothesis testing to real-world A/B testing scenarios in digital products.

Defined experiment lifecycles, from hypothesis setup to result analysis.

Emphasized the importance of random assignment, metric definition, and minimum sample size.

Practiced interpreting A/B test results for actionable business insights.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 5: STATISTICAL INFERENCE FOR PROPORTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
Built and interpreted confidence intervals for one and two population proportions.

Conducted 1-sample and 2-sample proportion z-tests, including test statistic and p-value interpretation.

Applied these methods to survey results, conversion rates, and marketing data.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 6: STATISTICAL INFERENCE FOR MEANS
------------------------------------------------------------
Constructed confidence intervals for one or two population means using the t-distribution.

Performed 1-sample and 2-sample t-tests with assumptions and interpretation of output.

Extended inference to more than two groups using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).

Tested overall group differences while controlling the Type I error rate.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 7: INFERENCE FOR CATEGORICAL DATA
------------------------------------------------------------
Used Chi-Square Goodness of Fit tests to compare observed vs. expected frequencies.

Conducted Chi-Square Tests for Independence and Homogeneity with contingency tables.

Interpreted test statistics, degrees of freedom, and p-values in categorical contexts.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 8: PARAMETRIC VS. NON-PARAMETRIC METHODS
------------------------------------------------------------
Reviewed assumptions required for parametric tests: normality, equal variance, independent observations.

Introduced non-parametric methods like the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for use when assumptions are violated.

Practiced selecting appropriate tests based on the data type, scale, and distribution shape.
