    "The Q-Q plot provides a visual way to assess normality. Think of it as comparing your data's distribution to a perfect normal distribution. If the points follow a straight diagonal line, your data is approximately normal. Any systematic deviations from this line suggest non-normality (Outlier data points are easily highlighted via this method).\n",

    "The histogram with KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) overlay gives you an intuitive view of your data's shape. The KDE line helps you see if your distribution approximates the classic bell curve shape of a normal distribution.\n",

    "The Shapiro-Wilk test provides a numerical assessment. If the p-value is above your alpha level (typically 0.05), you don't have strong evidence against normality. The null hypothesis is that the data is normal. However, with large samples, even small deviations from normality can lead to significant results, which is why we always look at visualizations too.\n"
