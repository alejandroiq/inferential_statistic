    "\n",
    "You're working as a data analyst for a major retail chain that's analyzing their customer loyalty program. The marketing team wants to understand if there are patterns in how customers engage with their promotional campaigns. They've collected data on customer responses to different types of promotions (email, SMS, app notification) and whether customers made a purchase within 7 days of receiving the promotion. Additionally they also recorded the time of day when the promotion was opened/accessed and want to know if promotional engagement varies by the time of day.\n",

    "The marketing team needs your help to:\n",
    "- Determine if customers show preferences for when they engage with promotions (morning, afternoon, evening)\n",
    "- Investigate whether the type of promotion is related to customer purchase behavior\n",
